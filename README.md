# Create an Intelligent system using AIML to detect phishing domains which imitate look and feel genuine domains. 
## Solution

We are using AI/ML model i.e. random forest classifier to detect the phishing websites. We are using docker containers such that when user able to check it as a malicious link it should be opened in server side. This will create two layer security first one by machine learning model and other one by docker container containers.
