## Overview

This web interface allows users to check the safety of a URL by detecting whether it's a phishing website or not. The interface collects a URL from the user, sends it to a trained AI/ML model for analysis, and displays the result.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for URL input.
- Integration with a trained AI/ML model to detect phishing websites.
- Clear and simple result display.

## Working

1. Open the web interface in your browser.

2. Enter a URL into the input field.

3. Click the "Submit" button.

4. The URL will be sent to the AI/ML model for analysis.

5. The result page will display whether the URL is:
   - Phishing (1)
   - Safe (0)
   - Suspicious or needs further review (e.g., by a human expert)

## Future Improvements

- Integration with a Flask-based backend to handle AI/ML model interactions.
- Logging and analytics to monitor URL submissions and results.
